Bonus

The distance traveled by the snail is now defined by a list.

advance_cm = [30, 21, 33, 77, 44, 45, 23, 45, 12, 34, 55]
How long does it take to raise the well?

What is its maximum displacement in one day? And its minimum?

What is its average speed during the day?

What is the standard deviation of its displacement during the day?
