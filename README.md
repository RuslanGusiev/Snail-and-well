A snail falls at the bottom of a 125 cm well. Each day the snail rises 30 cm. But at night, while sleeping, slides 20 cm because the walls are wet. How many days does it take to escape from the well?

Goals

1. Treatment of variables

2.Use of loop while

3. Use of conditional if-else

4. Print in console


Bonus

The distance traveled by the snail is now defined by a list.

advance_cm = [30, 21, 33, 77, 44, 45, 23, 45, 12, 34, 55]

1. How long does it take to raise the well?

2. What is its maximum displacement in one day? And its minimum?

3. What is its average speed during the day?

4. What is the standard deviation of its displacement during the day?
